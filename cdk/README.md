# Android CI/CD Pipeline on AWS with CDK

This project provides a CDK codebase for deploying an infrastructure pipeline for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) of Android applications on AWS.
Features

- Creates a CodePipeline with stages for Build, Test, and Deploy.
- Integrates with CodeBuild for building your Android application.
- Leverages CodeArtifact for storing and managing build artifacts.
- Supports deploying the application to various environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) using CloudFormation.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- Node.js and npm installed.
- Basic understanding of CDK, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeArtifact.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

'''Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/android-cicd-cdk.git
'''

1. Install dependencies:

'''Bash

cd android-cicd-cdk
npm install
'''

1. CDK EnvTemplate

- Create a file named .env in the root directory of your project.
- Replace your_aws_region with your desired AWS region (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1).
- Replace your_account_id with your actual AWS account ID or a specific account alias.

```
# Region and Account for your AWS resources
REGION=your_aws_region

# This can be your account ID or a specific account alias
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id

```

> > Important Notes:
> >
> > Do not commit the .env file to version control. Include the .env file in your .gitignore file to prevent sensitive information like your account ID from being accidentally shared.
> > You can use different .env files for different environments (development, staging, production) to manage region and account specifics for each environment.

## Deploy the infrastructure:

'''Bash

npm run deploy
'''

Note: This command will deploy the infrastructure to your AWS account. Make sure you understand the associated costs before running it.

## Usage

After successful deployment, you can trigger the CI/CD pipeline by pushing changes to your code repository. The pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy your Android application.

## Additional Notes

    This is a basic example and can be extended to include additional functionalities like security scanning and notifications.
    Remember to update the code with your specific Android build commands and deployment configurations.
